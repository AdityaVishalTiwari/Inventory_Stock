# Optimizing Grocery Inventory Management

## Introduction 
This project aims to develop a predictive model to accurately forecast stock levels of products sold in a grocery store. By leveraging sales data and sensor data collected on an hourly basis, I seek to optimize procurement strategies and ensure efficient inventory management. The project consists of three main stages: Sales Data Analysis, Data Preprocessing, and ML Model Development.

## Stage 1: Sales Data Analysis
In this stage, I delve into the exploration and visualization of sales data to gain insights into product demand patterns. Key tasks include:

1) Data Exploration: Understanding the structure and characteristics of the sales data.
2) Data Visualization and Analysis: Utilizing visualizations and statistical analysis techniques to identify trends, seasonality, and anomalies in sales.

## Stage 2: Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is essential for preparing the raw data for modeling:

1) Data Loading: Loading sales data, sensor stock level data, and sensor storage temperature data.
2) Data Cleaning: Identifying and handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data.
3) Merge Data: Integrating multiple datasets to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis.
4) Feature Engineering: Creating relevant features from the merged data to enhance model performance.
5) Saving Final Processed Data: Storing the preprocessed data for use in the ML model development phase.

## Stage 3: ML Model Development
The core of the project involves developing machine learning models to predict stock levels based on the processed data. The following steps are undertaken:

1) Regression Techniques: Implementing regression algorithms such as Simple Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest Regression, and Simple Feed Forward Neural Network to forecast stock levels.
2) Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of each model using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as the evaluation metric.
3) Feature Importance Analysis: Understanding the significance of different features in predicting stock levels through feature importance analysis and visualization.

# Conclusion
By completing the stages outlined above, I can aim to develop more accurate and advance model that can help stores optimize their stocking strategies, minimize stockouts, and reduce excess inventory. The insights gained from this project can contribute to more intelligent procurement decisions, ultimately enhancing operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.
